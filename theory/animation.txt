CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript!
What are CSS Animations?
An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.
To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.


@keyframes
ex. @keyframes example {
  from {background-color: red;}
  to {background-color: yellow;}
}
animation-name
ex.animation-name: example;

animation-duration
animation-duration: 4s;

animation-delay
ex.animation-delay: 2s;

animation-iteration-count
ex.animation-iteration-count: 3;

animation-direction
The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.

The animation-direction property can have the following values:

normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards

animation-timing-function
ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end

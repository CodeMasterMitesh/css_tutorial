What is transition? 
CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

1)transition
A shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into a single property
ex. transition: width 2s, height 2s, transform 2s;

2)transition-delay
The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect
ex.transition-delay: 1s;

3)transition-duration
Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete
ex.transition-duration: 2s;

4)transition-property
Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for
transition-property: width;

5)transition-timing-function
Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect
The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end


shorthand property -> 
transition: width 2s linear 1s;

CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.
CSS defines three types of gradients:

1)Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
2)Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
3)Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)


1->
CSS Linear Gradients
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. 
Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. 
You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

ex.background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red , yellow);

Using Angles
ex.background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, red, yellow);
Using Multiple Color Stops
background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow, green);


Repeating a linear-gradient
ex.-> background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 20%);



2->
CSS Radial Gradients
A radial gradient is defined by its center.
To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.

ex.background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);

background-image: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow, green);

background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 15%);



3->
CSS Conic Gradients
A conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.
To create a conic gradient you must define at least two colors.
ex. background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);
background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green);background-image: conic-gradient(red 45deg, yellow 90deg, green 210deg);

background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(red 10%, yellow 20%);


background-image: conic-gradient(red 45deg, yellow 90deg, green 210deg);

background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(red 10%, yellow 20%);
